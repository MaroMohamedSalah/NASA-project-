                <p>They do not have an increased chance of fracture. Additionally, astronauts lose muscle mass in
                    microgravity more quickly than they would on Earth if they don't follow a healthy diet and exercise
                    regimen. In addition, the fluids in the body go to the head while in microgravity, which might put
                    pressure on the eyes and impair eyesight. Crews may have a greater risk of kidney stones owing to
                    dehydration and increased excretion of calcium from their bones if preventative or countermeasures
                    are not put in place.

                    Solution tried by NASA scientists:
                </h3>
                <p>In order to identify and enhance balance control after landing on a gravitational surface, functional
                    task testing is in place. Tests of fine motor skills are conducted to identify any changes in
                    astronauts' capacity to operate computer-based equipment. It may also be possible to pull fluids
                    from the brain into the legs with the use of a lower-body negative pressure device. The
                    physiological alteration that may raise the chance of kidney stones may be countered by medications
                    that NASA is researching, such as potassium citrate. NASA studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
                    bisphosphonate medicines in halting bone loss.
