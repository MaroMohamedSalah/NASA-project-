                    Mars without assistance from mission control at NASA. Before and throughout their space missions,
                    astronauts for the space station already get medical training that teaches them how to handle any
                    health issues. In order to create an intravenous (IV) solution from purified water that may be used
                    for medical administration, for instance, astronauts learn how to operate equipment on board the
                    space station. To keep track on organ health, crew members often conduct ultrasound tests on one
                    another. In the event that one crew member gets ill while on the trip, the team is prepared to
                    conduct laboratory tests to aid in making the proper diagnosis and directing treatment.

                <p>In order to allow the capabilities of clinical decision support systems, which might leverage
                    artificial intelligence and machine learning to further aid in the diagnosis and treatment of
                    various illnesses, NASA is attempting to establish a medical data architecture for spacecraft.
                    Researchers are also investigating how virtual assistants can enable crews on longer-distance trips
                    to swiftly recognize and react to spaceflight oddities.
